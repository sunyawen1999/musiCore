## Introduction
MusiCore is a full-stack project developed as a Spotify clone using the latest technologies of 2023, including Next.js 13.4, React, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, PostgreSQL, and Stripe. This tutorial-driven project will guide you through creating a complete music streaming application from the ground up.

## Technology Stack and Features

### Frontend
- **Next.js 13.4 & React:** Craft a responsive and dynamic user interface that emulates the clean and modern design of Spotify. Utilize the SSR and SSG capabilities of Next.js for optimized performance.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Implement a custom, responsive design quickly with Tailwind CSS, enhancing your application with animations and transition effects that provide a smooth and engaging user experience.

### Backend
- **Supabase:** Leverage Supabase, an open-source alternative to Firebase, built on PostgreSQL for backend services. You'll set up a Supabase project, design database schemas, and implement robust authentication processes for secure user registration and login.
- **PostgreSQL:** Utilize the powerful SQL database to manage your applicationâ€™s data with efficiency and security.

### Features
- **Stripe Integration:** Implement Stripe for handling premium subscriptions. Learn how to manage transactions and user billing securely to provide premium users with an uninterrupted service.
- **Music Functionalities:** Users can upload songs, create and manage playlists, like songs, and enjoy a dynamic Favorites system. The application supports full CRUD operations (POST, GET, DELETE) in route handlers.
- **Authentication and Storage:** Integrate GitHub authentication and manage user credentials with Supabase. Utilize Supabase storage for file and image uploads.
- **Advanced Components:** Features an advanced player component, server-side data fetching in React without an API, and real-time handling of component relationships.
